This package consists of components that act as wrappers around existing highcharts graphs, adding custom styling (currently) and functionality(in the future). To use other Highcharts graphs not included in this library, please use them directly from [this library](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts-react)

Included charts are:
* Area
* Hbar (Horizontal Bar Chart)
* Vbar (Column chart)
* Pie (Donut charts)

Note that all components within this package are abstracted Highcharts components, and as such will be subject to all props and options except ones related to visual styling, specified in [Highcharts documentation](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/).
