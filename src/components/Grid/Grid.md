The Grid package provides components that help create HTML layouts conforming to the following grid system:

The package comes with 4 components:
* __Container__ : At the moment, this only provides a top level div that ensures that it fills up the viewport and passes appropriate sizes on to its DOM children. This nis ideally used only once per page, and at the top level of your DOM.
* __Header__ : This provides an appropriately sized header with flex-box layouting enabled. This is ideally used as part of your own header component.
* __Content__ : Content provides the gray background for all display pages, as outlined in the [style guide](https://xd.adobe.com/view/0b45c23e-341f-471f-6e07-a666f064272d-7d74/)

* __Panel__ : This will be the component, you will use the most from this package and has been documented in detail here.
